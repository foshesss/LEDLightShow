# LEDLightShow
#### Last updated: 10/7/22
Created with an Arduino. While not entirely advanced, I'm relatively new to anything electrical engineering. To be honest, I wanted to try something new. This is still largely a work in progress and a side project for myself.

## How does it work?
I'm using a sound module to listen to audio (it's like a microphone). From there, it is sending signals into the Arduino, which processes everything and shoots out commands to the LED lights.
